      Beside  that,  I  also  share  a  lot  of  other  resources  with  you  in  this  e-­‐book,  in  order  to  make  your  life  as  a  web  designer  and  developer  a  lot  easier!  I  found  all  of  these  tools  and  resources  over  a  period  of  years,  spending  days  of  my  precious  .me  looking  for  things  that  I  needed.
